    "technique": "Brute Force",
    "tactic": "Credential Access",
    "description": "Adversaries may use brute force techniques to gain access to accounts when passwords are unknown or when password hashes are obtained. Without knowledge of the password for an account or set of accounts, an adversary may systematically guess the password using a repetitive or iterative mechanism. Brute forcing credentials can take place via interaction with a service that will check the validity of those credentials or offline against previously acquired credential data, such as password hashes."

    "technique": "Password Guessing",
    "tactic": "Credential Access",
    "description": "Adversaries with no prior knowledge of legitimate credentials within the system or environment may guess passwords to attempt access to accounts. Without knowledge of the password for an account, an adversary may opt to systematically guess the password using a repetitive or iterative mechanism. An adversary may guess login credentials without prior knowledge of system or environment passwords during an operation by using a list of common passwords."

    "technique": "Valid Accounts",
    "tactic": "Defense Evasion, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Initial Access",
    "description": "Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of existing accounts as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on systems within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems and externally hosted services."

  "T1071": {
    "technique": "Application Layer Protocol",
    "tactic": "Command and Control",
    "description": "Adversaries may communicate using OSI application layer protocols to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic. Commands to the remote system, and often the results of those commands, will be embedded within the protocol traffic between the client and server."
  },
  "T1046": {
    "technique": "Network Service Scanning",
    "tactic": "Discovery",
    "description": "Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of services running on remote hosts and local network infrastructure devices, including those that may be vulnerable to remote software exploitation. Methods to acquire this information include port scans and vulnerability scans using tools that are brought onto a system."

    "technique": "Remote Desktop Protocol",
    "tactic": "Lateral Movement",
    "description": "Adversaries may use Valid Accounts to log into a computer using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). The adversary may then perform actions as the logged-on user."

  "T1059.004": {
    "technique": "Unix Shell",
    "tactic": "Execution",
    "description": "Adversaries may abuse Unix shell commands and scripts for execution. Unix shells are the primary command prompt on Linux and macOS systems, though many variations of the Unix shell exist (e.g. sh, bash, zsh, etc.)"
